"training is about doing it again and again- even when no one is watching,
its the slient dialouge between you and your craft,
its the focused repetition that turns your movement into instinct,
your skill into art and, your vision into reality,
thats training,

the real purpose of training isn't to win a trophy,
but to test the limits of the human mind,
the real purpose of training isn't to conquer others,
but to conqure the unaspiring within ourselves,
thats training"
